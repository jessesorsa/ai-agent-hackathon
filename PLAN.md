## Problems

- Meetings
    - Pulling data before a meeting takes time from different apps
- Product
    - Getting product data from different systems takes time
    - Product Requirements Document creation for new features
- Founder led sales / sales
    - Just using and managing many tools is slow (you usually just want to do some one thing in a single app)
    - It's slow to research a company to find out if it fits our company ICP (finding really really good fits)
    - It's slow to manually search for people from ICP companies
    - Adding company, deal, contact info to CRMs (Notion for early stage is annoying manual process)
    - Updating object info in CRMs is annoying
    - UIs of many CRMs are horrible to use
    - Writing emails by hand wastes time
- Data analysis
    - Static data-analysis tools are not flexible enough
    - Non technical people have to use ready built tools (restricting)
    - Technical people have to write SQL (they already copy it from gpt)
    - Dashboards that are pretty (to show in meetings etc.) are not easy to do for hardcore data-analysts
- General
    - Chat UI for agents is very restricting (wall of text)
    - All applications use static complicated UIs which are annoying and super time consuming to use
